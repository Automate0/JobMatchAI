    "description": "Who we are\n\nAbout Stripe\n\nStripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.\n\nAbout The Team\n\nOur Growth team is on a mission to acquire, convert and grow millions of merchants globally across Stripe’s full suite of financial products. We are a cross functional team of engineers, scientists, marketers, designers and product managers that deliver the insights, algorithms, internal systems and tools, and user-facing experiences that fuel Stripe’s growth. In short we make it easy for people to act on their interest in Stripe.\n\nAs part of the Growth Engineering team, you will build and own the systems, products, internal tools, and customer-facing experiences that power intelligence behind our go-to-market and product-led growth. This includes building our ML powered recommendations and growth experimentation engine(s), multi-channel notifications systems, and key growth-related customer experiences (e.g., onboarding experiences, user dashboards, product recommendations).\n\nWhat you’ll do\n\nResponsibilities\n\n\n * Partner closely with other engineers and scientists to build highly scalable, ML driven system(s), help run experiments, and surface insights across all points of customer interactions.\n * Create beautiful web surfaces and interactive dashboard experiences using technologies such as React, JavaScript, CSS and GraphQL. Build the APIs that power these experiences, defining composable data models and durable interfaces.\n * Scope, design, and lead technical projects, laying the groundwork for early-stage products to iteratively evolve and scale.\n * Ensure our UI components and libraries are reliable, secure, extensible and accessible.\n * Debug production issues across services and multiple levels of the stack with an eye towards improving maintainability over the long term.\n * Improve engineering standards, tooling, and processes.\n * Interact with product and business leaders to help develop and execute on a data-first growth strategy that scales with Stripe.\n   \n   \n   \n\nWho you are\n\nWe’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.\n\nMinimum Requirements\n\n\n * 5+ years of professional hands-on software development experience.\n * You are an expert at building web applications using HTML, CSS, and at least one JavaScript framework like React.js, AngularJS or Backbone.js.\n * You have implemented server-side APIs in dynamic languages like Ruby, working with document and relational datastores (especially Mongo and MySQL).\n * You enjoy spelunking through new datasets (especially in systems like Redshift or Presto/Trino).\n * You have a deep understanding of usability issues in web applications.\n * You have excellent oral and written communication.\n * You have proven ability to thrive in a collaborative environment involving different stakeholders and subject matter experts.\n   \n   \n   \n\nPreferred Qualifications\n\n\n * Experience with machine learning, recommender systems, product-led growth, and/or lifecycle marketing.\n   \n   \n   \n\nHybrid work at Stripe\n\nThis role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).\n\nOffice-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.\n\nA remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.\n\nPay and benefits\n\nThe annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$172,000 - C$258,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.\n\nSpecific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.",

    "description": "Who we are\n\nAbout Stripe\n\nStripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.\n\nAbout The Team\n\nThe Billing organization at Stripe builds and operates Stripe Billing. Stripe Billing is a growing product vertical inside of Stripe. Hundreds of thousands of businesses of all sizes and types use Stripe Billing to drive their revenue engines and operate their business models. Stripe Billing enables customers to collect revenue for recurring and one-time payments across a variety of different pricing models. It provides advanced features like revenue retention and recovery, enabling customers to retain their users and grow their businesses. Our work on Stripe Billing spans multiple technologies and product domains. To support even the most unique and complex business models, our technology and products must be configurable and programmable. This requires our team to innovate in how we model different types of businesses, and how we use technology to enable customers to piece together Stripe’s Billing’s platform primitives into holistic solutions that support any type of business. Through this work, Stripe Billing allows worry-free innovation and evolution of any customer’s business model. Stripe is defining the industry’s approach to Billing solutions; we’re looking for innovators to join us.\n\nWhat you’ll do\n\nAs an engineer on the team, you’ll be responsible for shaping and building a suite of products that let our users model and operate their business more efficiently. You will work on projects that span technologies, systems, and processes where you will design, build, test, and ship great code every day. In this cross functional role, you will collaborate with experts in infrastructure, security, design, and operations to build mission critical internal and external features that power Stripe users around the world.\n\nResponsibilities\n\n\n * Work with a wide range of systems, processes and technologies to own and solve problems.\n * Work closely with engineers, designers, and product managers to build new features and products.\n * Uphold our high engineering standards and bring consistency to the many codebases and processes you will encounter.\n * Build elegant APIs and user experiences that enable merchants to run and scale their businesses on top of Stripe\n * Contribute to the design and architecture of the next generation of Stripe’s infrastructure, to meet the high growth needs of our company and customers for years to come.\n   \n   \n   \n\nWho you are\n\nWe’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.\n\nMinimum Requirements\n\n\n * You have 3+ years of experience as a software engineer.\n * You have an entrepreneurial mindset.\n * You enjoy data modeling challenges and have a high bar for keeping your solutions expressive yet simple to use.\n * Enjoy being a generalist designing and working on both the frontend and/or backend, and anything it takes to solve problems and delight users.\n * Take pride in working on projects to successful completion involving a wide variety of technologies and systems.\n * Can stitch together many different services and processes together even if you have not worked with them before.\n * Can put yourself in the shoes of your users and be a steward of crafting great experiences.\n * Thrive in a collaborative environment involving different stakeholders.\n * You’re obsessed with product quality and don’t settle for “good enough.”\n   \n   \n   \n\nHybrid work at Stripe\n\nThis role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).\n\nOffice-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.\n\nA remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.\n\nPay and benefits\n\nThe annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$135,200 - C$258,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.\n\nSpecific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.",

    "description": "Who we are\n\nAbout Stripe\n\nStripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.\n\nAbout The Team\n\nStripe’s Developer Experience & Product Platform (DEeP) organization empowers all of Stripe's products with a shared product platform that helps with rapidly delivering high-quality, cross-product experiences across our UI and API surfaces. It focuses on providing a consistent and scalable developer experience that any developer (both internal and external) can leverage to accelerate a merchant’s ability to create value using Stripe.\n\nYou may work on a wide variety of critical business areas including:\n\nMerchant Experience: This team builds much of the backend and frontend platform that powers the Stripe Dashboard. Millions of businesses use the Dashboard every day to manage their operations, and thousands of Stripes build product experiences in the Dashboard to enable these businesses to succeed.\n\nOrganizations & Authentication Platform (OAP): This team is responsible for building Organizations, which allows merchants to effectively and centrally manage their businesses across multiple Stripe accounts. It also maintains the authentication platform, which powers the authentication experience for the Stripe dashboard and all products hosted on it. As Stripe continues to grow its suite of product offerings beyond payments, Organizations will unlock a new phase of growth for Stripe. We will do this by enabling our platforms and businesses to model their complex businesses and distribute all of Stripe’s products to their end users.\n\nDeveloper Platform: This team builds Stripe's API platform and external developer experience. They focus on external merchants and how they communicate with Stripe – via SDK, docs, and developer tools such as Workbench and sandboxes.\n\nTeam Matching Note: Matching you with one of the sub-teams within DEeP will begin during the final stage of the interview process.\n\nWhat you’ll do\n\nWe’re looking for backend, frontend leaning fullstack, and fullstack engineers who are interested in building software services and platforms that impact thousands of employees and millions of Stripe users, regardless of whether they’re an end user, developer, or partner.\n\nResponsibilities\n\n\n * Ensure our platforms are reliable, scalable, secure, and extensible\n * Shape future-proof interfaces that are easy to build with\n * Make effective tradeoffs that consider business priorities, user experience, and a sustainable technical foundation\n * Help drive sound technical decision making and lead technical conversations with other teams across Stripe\n * Debug production issues across services and various levels of the tech stack\n   \n   \n   \n\nWho you are\n\nWe’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.\n\nMinimum Requirements\n\n\n * 2+ years of industry backend, frontend, or fullstack engineering experience building end-to-end user solutions (does not include internships or co-ops).\n * Strong coding skills in any programming language. We understand new languages can be learned on the job so our interview process is language agnostic.\n * Experience debugging complex problems across the whole stack.\n * Thrive in a collaborative environment involving engineers, designers, and others to identify high-impact ways of solving problems quickly.\n * Interest in working as a generalist across varying technologies and stacks to solve problems and delight both internal and external users.\n * Excellent oral and written communication.\n   \n   \n   \n\nHybrid work at Stripe\n\nThis role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).\n\nOffice-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.\n\nA remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.\n\nPay and benefits\n\nThe annual salary range for this role in the primary location is C$134,400 - C$258,000. This range may change if you are hired in another location. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (“OTE”) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.\n\nSpecific benefits and details about what compensation is included in the salary range listed above will vary depending on the applicant’s location and can be discussed in more detail during the interview process. Benefits/additional compensation for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; retirement plans; health benefits; and wellness stipends.",

    "description": "Hi, we are ecobee.\n\necobee introduced the world’s first smart Wi-Fi thermostat to help millions of consumers save money, conserve energy, and bring home automation into their lives. That was just the beginning. We continue our pursuit to create technology that brings peace of mind into the home and allows people to focus on the moments that matter most. We take pride in making a meaningful difference to the environment, all while being part of the exciting, connected home revolution.\n\nIn 2021, ecobee became a subsidiary of Generac Power Systems. Generac introduced the first affordable backup generator and later created the category of automatic home standby generator. The company is committed to sustainable, cleaner energy products poised to revolutionize the 21st century electrical grid. Together, we take pride in making a meaningful difference to the environment.\n\nWhy we love to do what we do:\n\nWe’re helping build the world of tomorrow with solutions that improve everyday life while making a positive impact on the planet. Our products and services work in harmony to provide comfort, efficiency, and peace of mind for millions of homes and businesses. While we’re proud of what we’ve done so far, there’s still a lot we can do—and you can be part of it.\n\nJoin our extraordinary team.\n\nWe're a rapidly growing global tech company headquartered in Canada, in the heart of downtown Toronto, with a satellite office in Leeds, UK (and remote ecopeeps in the US). We get to work with some of North America and UK's leading professionals. Our colleagues are proud to bring their authentic selves to work, confident that what we do is grounded in a greater purpose. We’re always looking for curious, talented, and passionate people to join our team.\n\nWho You'll Be Be Joining\n\nOur Embedded Chapter is made up of 20+ Embedded Developers with a wide variety of specialties, skill sets, backgrounds, and experiences. They aim to bring their Embedded experience to the cross-functional squads that they are a part of, with a focus on collaboration, learning, development. This role could be remote or hybrid!\n\nHow You'll Make An Impact\n\nAs an Intermediate Embedded Engineer, you will be responsible for helping develop the software that powers our hardware products. These devices run on a multitude of platforms from small, battery operated microcontrollers to full-blown multicore embedded Linux systems.\n\nThe embedded team is in a unique position as we own a wide breadth of the technologies that get built into our devices making each day a unique challenge. You may be working on portions of the low-level software/hardware interactions, but equally important is the development of the user applications that run on device. Everything from network protocols, to control algorithms to building enticing graphic UI’s.\n\nThe embedded team is also responsible for developing the test fixtures used to validate the functionality of each device manufactured. These devices are truly products on their own and no less complex considering the hardware and software systems they must interface with.\n\nAside from the in-house technologies, the embedded team is often also responsible for integrating third-party services. For example, we developed the device software stack that allowed us to become one of the first Apple HomeKit accessories on the market as well as more recently one of the first third parties to integrate Amazon Voice Services for Alexa functionality built right into a thermostat.\n\nTo accomplish all of this, at any given time you may be working closely with developers from other teams as well as our QA, Product Management, Manufacturing, Hardware teams and third-party tech companies on integrations.\n\nWhat You'll Bring To The Table\n\nWe've built the following list as a guideline for some of the skills and interests we've seen in Embedded Systems Development - but we strive to build our team with members from a diverse background and skill set, so we'd love to chat!\n\n\n * C++ development experience\n * Object-oriented design and coding skills with knowledge of data structures and design patterns\n * Multi-threaded design and coding practices\n * Knowledge of ARM architecture-based processors and development tools\n * GUI development\n * Aptitude in programming for reliability and testability\n * Knowledge of Home Automation, Control Systems or Internet of Things\n * Knowledge of embedded Linux systems\n * Just so you know - the hired candidate will be required to complete a background check.\n   \n   \n\nWhat happens after you apply:\n\nApplication review. It will happen. By an actual person in Talent Acquisition. We get upwards of 100+ applications for some roles, it can take a few days, but every applicant can expect a note regarding their application status.\n\nInterview Process:\n\n\n * Initial round: A 30-minute phone call with a member in Talent Acquisition\n * Virtual Interview with Hiring Manager: This one-hour session will encompass technical, behavioral, and situational questioning, aimed at evaluating your qualifications and fit for the role\n * Technical Assessment/Final Interview: A 90 mins Peer technical panel (live coding exercise) with members of our team to delve into your technical expertise and experience.\n   \n   \n\nWith ecobee, you’ll have the opportunity to:\n\n\n * Be part of something big: Get to work in a fresh, dynamic, and ever-growing industry.\n * Make a difference for the environment: Make a sustainable impact while on your daily job, and after it through programs like ecobee acts.\n * Expand your career: Learn with our in-house learning enablement team, and enjoy our generous professional learning budget.\n * Put people first: Benefit from competitive salaries, health benefits, and a progressive Parental Top-Up Program (75% top-up or five bonus days off).\n * Play a part on an exceptional culture: Enjoy a fun and casual workplace with an open concept office, located at Queens Quay W & York St. ecobee Leeds is based at our riverside office on the Calls.\n * Celebrate diversity: Be part of a truly welcoming workplace.
